# Gluttonous-Snake
A small game demo(not complete)
It has been three months since I had studied font-end. 
Began with a new MACBOOK-PRO, followed some vidioes in blibli, and kinds of website like freecodecamp, github, stack overflow, MDN.
After learning HTML, CSS, JS, Typora, ZSH, Git, TS, this small Gluttonous Snake game was made in five days, five funny days.
The foundation is based on course of atguigu in bilibili. I added some buttons and a setting menu, also several functions.
There are still several bugs and the setting is not complete too.
I guess I will complete the project after several months, or a few years. During the time I am a real font-end developer.
Set your imagination out, add any functions you want to act in this game.
